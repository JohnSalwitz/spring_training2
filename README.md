Spring Training Web App In Spreadsheet like format


## notes to self...

a) Schedule was generated using "TruckScraper".  No current integration (scraping) with ticket brokers
b) Scraped in mid October but game data came up in early November
c) Tickets went on sale for Milwakee on about Nov 15th.  Other tix not available
d) Added "purchases" directly to schedule data table.  Might be better if this where seporate list or maybe even go to non-static website
e) Hosted using AWS Amplify.
